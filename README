Ansible
=======

This is a version of Ansible maintained by 2ndQuadrant for internal use.

If you do not work at 2ndQuadrant, please use Ansible from the official
repository at https://github.com/ansible/ansible

Otherwise, the default master branch is the code you should use. It
tracks the upstream devel (currently 2.0) branch, but also includes
various local changes.

See ANSIBLE.md for the contents of the upstream README.md
